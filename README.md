Inspired by xkcd 493:
We specialize in the crushing of dreams.
Did you love a movie when you were young? 
Was that movie old, or have any particularly old-ish sorta blokes?

Satisfy any of your morbid curiosities in two easy steps! Simply search up the movie you want, and click!
Find out how much of the cast of any movie has croaked! We'll also do the calculations to predict when EVERYONE will be dead!


Note: after clicking on the results page, there will be a long delay (~20 seconds) as our minions scour the archives. The site has (probably) not broken.
